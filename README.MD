## About
Citypop Central is a database storing information about Japanese songs. Most of the songs stored in our database are a mix of Japanese Jazz, Soul, Funk, Disco, or Synth-Pop from the '70s and '80s. These songs are better known under the genre Citypop. 

Back in the '80s, Japan had a very strong economy and this era was known as the 'Bubble economy' after. Everybody had a good income, poverty almost did not exist and a lot of money was spent during those years. Life was good, especially in the nightlife districts of Tokyo and other big Japanese cities. It was during those years that the Citypop genre became very popular. 

The lyrics in a Citypop song translated the spirit of the Japanese people at that time. Most songs are about a bright future, optimism, and a glamorous lifestyle. This all ended around the year 1991 when the Tokyo stock exchange, the Nikkei had plummeted to half. The glamorous lifestyle of the 80s was over and many Japanese people had lost their job and did not know what the future would bring. Together with this economic crash, the City pop genre disappeared making space for new types of music genres at that time.

Citypop was never popular in the Western world in the '80s. But thanks to Youtube these days, people from the West are discovering this music genre in the last couple of years. This database was mainly made to target these people who want to know more about the Citypop genre.
